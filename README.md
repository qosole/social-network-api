# Mock Social Network API

## Description 

A server that holds information about various people in a social network. The server allows you to view all users, all "thoughts," and all reactions, as well as interact with them. Some examples of interactions are adding users, removing users, adding friends, removing friends, adding thoughts, removing thoughts, etc.

This project was my first look into using a non-SQL database for a server (MongoDB).
